# Project README

## Overview
This project is a C++ application that provides functionalities for user management, guitar learning, and a game environment. It includes classes for different user levels, a game implementation, and a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Files
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main implementation code for the project.
- `acoustic.txt`: Text file containing data related to acoustic guitar.
- `electric.txt`: Text file containing data related to electric guitar.
- `ukulele.txt`: Text file containing data related to ukulele.
- `background.png`: Image file used for the background in the GUI.

## Classes and Functionalities
### User Management
- `User`: Manages user data, registration, and login functionalities.

### Guitar Learning
- `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, `Expert`: Classes providing different levels of guitar learning functionalities.

### Game Environment
- `LRT_GAME`: Implements a game environment where users can play and learn musical notes and chords.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- `GameGUI`: Provides a graphical interface for the game environment.

## Usage
1. Compile and run `main.cpp` to start the application.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the application for user registration, guitar learning, and playing the game.
3. Use the provided text files (`acoustic.txt`, `electric.txt`, `ukulele.txt`) for reference or additional data.

## Dependencies
- This project may require additional libraries such as SFML for graphical functionalities. Ensure proper setup and installation of dependencies before running the application.
